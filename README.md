# Initiative-Tracker
Project for WhiskerHacks Hackathon 2023

Inspired by Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition combat rules. This program is not to be used commercially, but rather as a free tool for 
Game Masters for any Tabletop RPG games. 

Currently in concept stage, ideal features to be added (following dnd 5e rules) include:

- Web/mobile browser compatibility
- Column with conditions (charmed, stunned, poisoned, etc)
- Visualization of enemy stat blocks (from a site like dndbeyond free stat blocks)
- On site dice roller for creature modifiers for specific attacks/abilities/saving throws
- Custom creature stat block builder to include in initiative (can be used for players)
- Save/Load feature for sessions that end mid-combat
